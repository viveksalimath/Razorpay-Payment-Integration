How to run the project 

I'll help you install and run the Razorpay Django application. Here are the steps:

First, create and activate a virtual environment:
>python -m venv venv





Install the required packages:
>pip install django razorpay



Navigate to the project directory:
>cd PaymentGatewaysDjango/razorpay



Run database migrations:
>python manage.py makemigrations



>python manage.py migrate



Create a superuser for admin access:
>python manage.py createsuperuser



Start the development server:
>python manage.py runserver


The application should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Important notes:

Make sure you have a Razorpay account and API keys
Update the settings.py file with your Razorpay API key and secret key
The base app is configured and ready to handle payments
Access the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin using your superuser credentials
You can now test the payment integration functionality through the application interface.
